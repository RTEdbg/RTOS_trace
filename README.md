# RTOS trace using the RTEdbg toolkit

For now, only tracing for the FreeRTOS real-time operating system is available.

## FreeRTOS trace

See the **[RTEdbg trace macro integration guide FreeRTOS](FreeRTOS/RTEdbg_trace_macro_integration_guide_FreeRTOS.adoc)** for instructions on how to integrate RTEdbg toolkit based RTOS trace into the FreeRTOS system. All files necessary for the trace integration are in the `FreeRTOS/v1` folder.

See also some additional hints about how to add logging FreeRTOS internal fault detection in the document **[RTOS Error Handling and Reporting](RTOS_Error_Handling_and_Reporting.md)**.
